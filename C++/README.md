#### File Structure

```
--C++
 |---Errors
 |    |--- Files
 |---Task
      |--- Files
```

- The C++ folder contains two subfolders 📁 namely Errors and Tasks.
- 🐞 Errors folder contains files that have some errors in the code which you need to find (Eg.Missing Brackets, function_names,Runtime errors etc.)
- ⚒ Tasks folder contains some empty files with comments which will guide you towards how to complete that particular task.

## Time to contribute

- Once you find an issue that suits you from the issues page --- the name of that issue is the file path where you'll find the required resources. (Eg. Name of issue is C++/Errors/Make_it_run.cpp thus you can find the files in the C++ folder --> Errors --> Make_it_run.cpp file)

- Now fork the repository, rectify the issue, create a pull request to that issue, and if you are right then your rectifications will be merged.
