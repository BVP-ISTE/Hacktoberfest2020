#### File Structure

```
--HTML&CSS
 |---Errors
 |    |--- Files
 |---Task
      |--- Files
```

- The HTML folder contains two subfolders 📁 namely Errors and tasks.
- 🐞 Errors folder contains files that have some errors in the code which you need to find (Eg.Fixing the alignment,Changing to correct color scheme)
- ⚒ Tasks folder contains some empty files with comments wich will guide you towards how to complete that particular task (Eg.A screenshot of required front-end is given you need to replicate the same in code).

## Time to contribute
