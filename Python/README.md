```
--Python
 |---Errors
 |    |--- Files
 |---Task
      |--- Files
```

- The Python folder contains two subfolders 📁 namely Errors and tasks.
- 🐞 Errors folder contains files that have some errors in the code which you need to find (Eg.Indentation,Colons,Runtime errors etc.)
- ⚒ Tasks folder contains some empty files with comments wich will guide you towards how to complete that particular task.

## Time to contribute
