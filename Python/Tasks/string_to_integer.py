# String to Integer

# Write a recursive function to convert a given string into the number it represents.

# That is input will be a numeric string that contains only numbers, you need to convert the string into corresponding integer and return the answer.

# Read input as specified in the question.
# Print output as specified in the question.
# implement the conv(s) function recursively

def conv(s):
        return int(s)

s = input(str("What the number?"))
print(conv(s))
